                    We created a secure and personal IoT wardrobe management app where users can create an account, log into an existing account, and maintain secure sessions. Upon authentication users are directed to their personalized profile where they can register new sensor devices to their account, monitor real-time environmental data, and view temperature trends in their city. Authorized users are also given access to their personal wardrobe and dashboard, where they can keep track of all of their clothes by adding/removing items from their closet, or even chat with their AI-powered assistant!
